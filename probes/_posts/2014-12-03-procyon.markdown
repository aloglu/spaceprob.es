PROCYON, short for PRoximate Object Close flYby with Optical Navigation, is a space probe set to conduct flybys of asteroids. The space probe is designed to use its optical telescope as a way of navigating closely around asteroids. The exact asteroid(s) it plans to target will be selected when the probe conducts a flyby of Earth at the end of 2015. PROCYON was launched as a secondary payload aboard the rocket that carried <a href="/hayabusa2/">Hayabusa 2</a> to space.
