Akatsuki is a space probe that was intended for Venus but failed to enter orbit around the planet in 2010 when its main engine died. The space probe then spent five years in orbit around the Sun before attempting again to enter into an orbit around Venus. In 2015, Akatsuki successfully entered orbit around Venus, albeit a farther orbit than originally intended. Now at Venus, Akatsuki will study the weather, atmosphere and surface of the planet. The mission also hopes to confirm the presence of active volcanoes and thunder on Venus.
